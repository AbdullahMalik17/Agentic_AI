# MCP(Model Context Protocal)
`Model Context Protocol (MCP)` is a standard or method for providing context to a language model (like GPT) so it can generate relevant and coherent responses. The protocol defines how previous messages, instructions, or data are structured and sent to the model.It helps us to get data from other application to give good response . 

# Tools
It's tools are as follows:
- HTTP 
- JSON-RPC 
- OAuth 2.1

# OAuth
It enables the autentication to get data . Anyone has no access to it .
# Working 
Basically , It's working is simialar to API . But it is considered as a tool of rapper on it .
# Limitation 
- Remote Agent is connected to our Agent as tools 
- We are not connected to global agents .
## Resolve
- Google give A2A protocol to connect remote Agent as a agent . He checks all the capabilities of agent through agent card and autonomously use the agent .
