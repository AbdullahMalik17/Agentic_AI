# OpenAI SDK

The **OpenAI SDK** is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to interact programmatically with OpenAI's models and services. It simplifies the process of integrating AI capabilities, such as natural language processing, code generation, and image creation, into applications.

## Key Features

- **API Access:** Provides convenient methods to call OpenAI APIs for tasks like text completion, chat, embeddings, and more.
- **Authentication:** Handles secure API key management and authentication.
- **Error Handling:** Offers built-in mechanisms for managing API errors and rate limits.
- **Streaming:** Supports streaming responses for real-time applications.
- **Customization:** Allows configuration of model parameters, such as temperature, max tokens, and system prompts.

## Example Usage

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, OpenAI!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Supported Languages

- Python (official SDK)
- Community SDKs for JavaScript, Node.js, and other languages
