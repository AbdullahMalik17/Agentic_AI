# Crew AI

Crew AI is a framework for orchestrating(Team work) multiple AI agents to work together as a crew to accomplish complex tasks. It enables:

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Create teams of specialized AI agents that can communicate and work together
- **Task Delegation**: Automatically distribute subtasks among crew members based on their roles and capabilities
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents can work independently while coordinating their efforts through a defined workflow
- **Role-Based Architecture**: Define different roles (like Researcher, Writer, Reviewer etc.) for specialized tasks

## Key Features

- Create crews with multiple AI agents
- Define agent roles and responsibilities 
- Coordinate complex workflows
- Handle task dependencies and sequencing
- Enable inter-agent communication
