# Agentic_AI
It means that we have the application that works autonomously . I give him work then , he is responsible to do it . 
## API (Application Programme Interface)
It helps us to get and send data to one another websites or devices . 
It acts like an bridge between two devices or websites .
# Chat completion API
It enables conservational natural language model between user .

# Creating python environment 
       python -m venv .venv
# Activation of python environment
       .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# Commad to make a package for agent 
        uv init --package name 
# To run my project 
        uv run name                  

This name is taken from through .toml file from script section  
# Cloud Native Technology
Cloud-native technology refers to the approach, tools, and processes used to build applications that fully embrace the advantages of cloud computing—such as scalability, flexibility, and automation. Simply put, these apps are architected, developed, and run specifically to thrive in cloud environments .    
## Core Concepts
- `Microservices` It divides the tasks into smaller tasks to perform it efficiently .
- `Container & Orchestration`Containerization (e.g., Docker) ensures services run consistently across environments. Orchestrators (commonly Kubernetes) manage deployment, scaling, updates, and self-healing . 
## ✅ Benefits
1. Scalability & Elasticity: Only scale parts that need it, saving costs .

2. Speed & Agility: Smaller components, automated pipelines = faster release cycles 

3. Resilience: Isolated services prevent cascading failures; auto-healing infrastructure 

4. Portability & Avoid Vendor Lock‑In: Containers and standard APIs enable multicloud or hybrid setups 
# Serverless Computing 
When we use the virtual computing , then we have to pay for only this time which we use it . This is called Serverless Computing . 

# We will make the agentic who is capable for following things:
- AI First 
- Cloud First 
- Cloud Anywhere
- Develop anywhere
