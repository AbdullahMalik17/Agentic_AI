# 🌐 What is Dapr?
Dapr stands for Distributed Application Runtime.

Think of Dapr as a helpful assistant that makes it easier to build cloud-native apps—especially those made up of multiple smaller services (this is called microservices architecture).
 
# Dapr gives you ready-made building blocks to help your apps:

- Talk to each other
- Store data
- Publish and subscribe to messages
- Call external APIs
- Handle secrets, and more
- And the best part? You don’t have to worry about the complex stuff behind the    scenes. You focus on your app, Dapr handles the rest.

# 🧱 Imagine This...
You’re building a system with different parts:

- One part handles orders
- Another handles payments
- Another sends email notifications
- Instead of writing a lot of extra code to make these parts talk to each other, Dapr gives you tools out-of-the-box to make this super easy and reliable
